# Obligatory_Tic-Tac-Toe_Game

This is the obligatory tic-tac-toe game.
Computer can play itself, you can play as X or O, and you can play against someone else.
Each turn, the computer will (1) win if it can; (2) block its opponent if they can win next turn; or (3) otherwise, it will play a random move.
